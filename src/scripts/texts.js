    "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say I said something wrong now I long for yesterday. Yesterday love was such an easy game to play now I need a place to hide away oh, I believe in yesterday. Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say I said something wrong now I long for yesterday. Yesterday love was such an easy game to play now I need a place to hide away oh, I believe in yesterday..."
